// ===================================================================================
//
// In this simple one-button game, a hunter (represented by a green LED) chases a deer
// (represented by a red LED). The player must press the button at the exact moment
// when the hunter catches up to the deer. If the button is pressed too early or too
// late, the game is lost. After each successful catch, the hunterâ€™s speed increases,
// making the game progressively more challenging as the player tries to maintain
// perfect timing. The objective is to see how many times the player can successfully
// catch the deer before missing.
